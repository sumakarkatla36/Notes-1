Computer
--------------
there are different types of computers 
Laptop
Desktop
Mobile
Tv
Refrigirator
washing machine

these machines have 
OS
CPU
RAM
STORAGE

Every machine has IP-Address

Mobile
------
OS -->Android,iphone,blackberry,google
RAM --> 8GB
STORAGE -->256,512
CPU -->Snapdragon 

WIFI/MOBILE -->IP Address

facebook.com is a server

based on purpose
mobile -->calling
laptop/desktop -->surf internet , browsing
Tv --> watching broadcast channels

server --> install applicatinon and serve users/clients

client server architecture
---------------------------
the one who requesting for information is client.
the one who is giving the information is server.

IT -->Communication between clients and servers

Operating Systems --> Linux
----------------------------
windows --> bridge between user and hardware

windows vs linux 
------------------
windows has graphics -->load increases on RAM , CPU
linux does not have graphics --> but very speed highly powerfull and stable.
high security.

How to connect to linux server ?
-----------------------------------
Auth mechanism
----------------
1.what you know --> username/password             --> Low security
2.what you have --> RSA Tokens                    --> Medium security
3.what you are  --> fingerprints,palms,retina etc --> High security

ssh --> secured shell

public key and private key will be generated.

Linux server = Node = Box

we need to generate the key 
the key can be generated by using a command ssh-keygen -f <file-name>

gitbash is nothing but Linux in windows it is used to connect ssh servers linux servers

$ pwd
/c/Users/sumak

when we try to create the key there are two files are created one is

1.sumakar.pub --> public key
2.sumakar     --> private key

ssh-rsa <code><laptop-name>

chepeast region --> us-east-1
availability zone --> there are two availability zones in a region.

EC2 --> elastic cloud computers

in AWS everything is called as resource

Ec2-->creation of servers.

firewall in AWS is called security groups

0.0.0.0/0 --> represents internet

Linux is not operating system --> it is a kernel

OS VS KERNEL
----------------
Kernel will connect to the hardware --> no utilities,no shell.

Linus Torvalds --> Linux

Unix --> very costly,tightly coupled to the hardware.

Linux --> based on UNIX Principles but code is from the scratch --> created by using C Language.

Linux is Open Source.

Kernel + package + shell = OS
Android is flavour of Linux

kernel + package + shell + UI 

Ubuntu
----------
ubuntu desktop --> kernel + Shell + UI

Server --> Kernel + shell 

most of the companies will use RHEL --> Open source but not free

Community 
RHEL = centos = fedora = almalinux

RHEL --> Code --> OS --> centos --> internet community.

IP = 34.226.191.211
username = ec2-user
privatekey

ssh-i <path-to-privatekey> username@IP

GitBash --> ssh client
Ec2 Server --> ssh server
protocol : ssh will use port number 22

when we give full path it is called absolute path.

when we give the pem file and ec2-user then it is called relative path.

pwd is present working directory.

$ --> normal user
# --> root user

pwd --> /home/ec2-user

uname --> it will give kernel name.

<command-name> <options> <inputs>

options and inputs are ocassionally optional

man uname
