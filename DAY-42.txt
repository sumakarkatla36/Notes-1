Merge conflicts
---------------------
if git finds different code in the same line number.then git will give merge conflicts

main 
-----
main --> conflict -->developer 1 created conflict branch from main branch.

developer-2
---------------
if there is a conflict the developer need to understand that the main branch is moved forward

he need to pull those changes in local,resolve conflicts with other developer-1

*** we need to do pull before push

Jenkins --> CICD
-----------------
continuous integration tool

create an ec2 server
install java and jenkins in it.

systemctl start jenkins

systemctl 

centos is the user-name
DevOps321 is the passwd


jenkins passwd : fd28030f4ac44f408c0aceee9fd1ebfa

whatever we do in jenkins it is called job,job is nothing but work to do.

freestyle job is not everyone using now a days,no one is preferrring now,restoring baack to normal stage is difficult.because of this
we have moved to pipeline.

jenkins pipelines
-----------------
hello world pipeline.

pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Hello') {
            steps {
                echo 'Hello World'
            }
        }
    }
}

1 person can handle --> one acre of agriculture

100 acres --> you need lot of resources

owwner --> employee resources --> distribute the work

master --> slave older version
master --> agent new versions

we need to add agents,agents is nothing but another server to do the work.

how you configure master and agent architecture in jenkins ?
if we have multiple agents.
--> we will go the manage jenkins.
--> then click on nodes
--> click new node,give the name of the node,and permanant agent.
--> click on create node.
--> no of executors is 3 based on our jobs
--> remote root directory == /var/jenkins-agent -->everything in jenkins will be saved here like jenkins configuration.

there are two launch methods.
1.master asking agent to work --> launch agent via ssh --> master is connecting to agent via ssh protocol.
HOST == PRIVATE IP.

2.employee coming to master and asking for .

while running the code the jenkins will check about what is the agent 
what is the node.and run the code.

post is used after the Build.

the pipeline  may be success or failed there are some conditions that we can run after the build.

-->environment is used as key value pairs.

Options
--------

options {
        timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') 
    }
	
it has to complete within the given time else it will give the error.

disableConcurrentBuilds() it is used to not run multiple builds at a time.
 
parameters{}
---------------
   parameters {
        string(name: 'PERSON', defaultValue: 'Mr Jenkins', description: 'Who should I say hello to?')

        text(name: 'BIOGRAPHY', defaultValue: '', description: 'Enter some information about the person')

        booleanParam(name: 'TOGGLE', defaultValue: true, description: 'Toggle this value')

        choice(name: 'CHOICE', choices: ['One', 'Two', 'Three'], description: 'Pick something')

        password(name: 'PASSWORD', defaultValue: 'SECRET', description: 'Enter a password')
    }
	
we can access the parameters inside the code 
steps{
 echo "Hello ${params.PERSON}"
 }
Triggers
-----------
build triggers are used when to trigger the build.

webhook
---------
hook is the connection between one to another.

if developer pushes the code to git we want the pipeline to run automatically

git --> jenkins

event comes in git like code push

then the webhook gives the information about the changes 

then the code will run in jenkins
