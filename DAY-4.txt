service management
-------------------
0-65,530 ports will be there

ssh port no is 22
http : 80
https : 443
mysql : 3306
SMTP : 25

Algorithm
----------
1.keygen 
2.public key import
3.firewall creation
4.instance creation
5.connect to server

-->Request reach ip-address
-->then it will goto ssh
-->system will check anything is running ssh process with port no 22
-->now authentication will be checked.

example: https://facebook.com

it will run on port no 443

443 https process is running 
then it will give login page

systemctl start nginx --> nginx will start running
nginx hhtp protocol port number is 80

to check the status of the service
systemctl status nginx
         or
ps -ef | grep nginx is used to check the status of the service.

systemctl enable nginx --> if services are enabled,after restart automatically services will run.

systemctl disable nginx

Network management
-------------------
netstat --> network statistics

netstat -lntp
 
-l → Show listening sockets only

-n → Show numeric addresses (don’t resolve hostnames or service names)

-t → Show TCP connections

-p → Show the PID and program name using the socket


troubleshooting process
------------------------
-->check the system resources
cpu memory high consumption
hard disk full
RAM full
-->process is running or not
-->port open or not
-->systemctl status <service>

-->firewall open or not

how to check system resources ?
------------------------------------------
top --> it is used to check the cpu memory used

df -hT -->it will give the information about harddisk space

free --> this command is used to check about the RAM.

free -M --> it will give in megabytes

how to check the processes?
---------------------------
ps -ef | grep nginx

how to check a port is opened or not?
------------------------------------------
netstat -lntp
how to check the status of the services?
-------------------------------------------------
systemctl status nginx

whenever the ram becoming full because of a process we have to kill the process.

How to give acccess to Linux user?
--------------------------------------
sudo su this command will give root user access

Linux Admin  --> full access to Linux
DevOps Admin --> limited sudo access

how to create a group ?
-----------------------------
groupadd admin
groupadd devops

ramesh --> Admin,add him to wheel group or give admin group full access
suresh --> DevOps

how to create a user?
-----------------------
useradd ramesh
this will add ramesh user to the Admin group --> usermod -g admin ramesh
id ramesh --> this command is used to check ramesh group

useradd suresh

usermod -g devops suresh

id suresh

how to check weather a user is root user or not?
-----------------------------------------------------
id -->if it will give 0 then it is a root user else it is not a root user

how to give access to the users?
------------------------------------
vim/etc/sudoers this is dangerous to open because we nay change the configuartion of the file

linux has given another simple way to change the file that is -->visudo
go to insert mode
below the %wheel add %admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
chnage the password authentication no to yes.

systemctl restart sshd.

passwd ramesh
create passwd
passwd suresh
create passwd

ssh ramesh@ip-address

for giving limited access
---------------------------
visudo

to give the particular commands
which yum 
which systemctl
add %devops ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl

3-tier architecture
---------------------
Disadvantages of desktop applications
more cpu ,RAM
we have to install
we have to upgrade

storage --> we loose data

portability --> we cant work from anywhere

web applications
----------------
googlesheets,docs
MS-OFFICE
