user=owner ==the file who created is called user or owner
group ==user a group lo unnadu is called group

in linux when you create user a group with same name is created.

when we create a user sumakar,a group with the same name sumakar will be created.

users has read access,write access
group has read access,write access
others has only read access

if we want to change the access the command used is chmod u+x this command will give user to execution access

chmod u+x sample

user management
-----------------
ramesh joined devops team

how to create a user in linux?

the command used to create a user in linux is useradd ramesh 

user created by using root user.

to get the sudo access the command used is sudo su -

how we know weather a user is created or not ?
in the /etc/passwd their is a entry will be created.

how to get the group entries?
getent group command is used to list the groups


vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config -->enable password authentication
sshd -t this command is used whenever we do a mistake in the file it will give the error.
systemctl restart sshd  --> restart the system.

now to login to the user the command is 
ssh sumakar@ip-address
it will ask for the user password.
then it will login to the user

2.how to create a group?
groupadd devops

3.every user will have a primary group and a secondary grouo

ramesh should be added to devops group

this is the way the user added to group -->usermod -g devops sumakar

chown -->even file owner cant run this command

only sudo user can change the ownership

4.we will create testing group ,we will give sumakar secondary access to testing

usermod -aG testing ramesh

5.to remove sumakar from testing group
gpasswd -d sumakar testing

user is leaving the organization
--------------------------------------
userdel <user-name> -->it will removes the user from linux system.

* if we want to delete a user the user should be logout from the server
* if we want to delete a user the user must be in no other groups.

to delete the group
---------------------
groupdel sumakar

process management
-------------------
ps -ef will show the processes running in background.

how do we know a process is runnning or not?
ps -ef | grep jenkins

there are two types of processes 
1.foreground process
2.background process

when process strucks we need to kill it
kill <p-id>

when some process stuck even kill can't kill it

kill -9 --> forcefully kill the process.
